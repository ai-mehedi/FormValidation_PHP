# PHP Form Handling Example

This project demonstrates basic form handling in PHP. It includes a simple HTML form for collecting user input and server-side validation to ensure the data is submitted correctly.

## Features

- **Input Validation:** Ensures that required fields are not empty and that the email and website fields contain valid entries.
- **Data Sanitization:** Uses PHP functions to trim whitespace, remove backslashes, and convert special characters to HTML entities.

## Form Fields

- **Name:** A text field for the user's name (required).
- **Email:** A text field for the user's email address, with validation for a proper email format (required).
- **Website:** A text field for the user's website URL, with validation for a proper URL format (optional).
- **Comment:** A textarea for additional comments (optional).
- **Gender:** Radio buttons for selecting the user's gender (required).
